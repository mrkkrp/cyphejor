;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows to shorten major mode names using a set of

  "Rules used to convert names of major modes.

Every element of the list must be of the following form:

  (STRING REPLACEMENT &rest PARAMETERS)

where STRING is a “word” in major mode symbol name, REPLACEMENT
is another string to be used instead, PARAMETERS is a list that
may be empty but may have the following keywords in it as well:

  :prefix—put it in the beginning of result string
  :postfix—put it in the end of result string

Apart from elements of the form described above the following
keywords are allowed (they influence the algorithm in general):

  :downcase—replace words that are not specified explicitly with
  their first letter downcased

  :upcase—replace words that are not specified explicitly with
  their first letter upcased

If nothing is specified, a word will be used unchanged, separated
from other words with spaces if necessary."
