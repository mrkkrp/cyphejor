This package allows to shorten major mode names using a set of user-defined
rules.

## Installation

If you would like to install the package manually, download or clone it and
put on Emacs' `load-path`. Then you can require it in your init file like
this:

```emacs-lisp
(require 'cyphejor)
```

It's available via MELPA, so you can just <kbd>M-x package-install RET
cyphejor RET</kbd>.

## Usage

First you need to set value of the variable `cyphejor-rules`. This variable
contains rules that the package uses to generate new names for major modes
from their symbol names (values of `major-mode` variable).

Value of `cyphejor-rules` should be a list. Every element of the list should
have the following form:

```emacs-lisp
(string replacement &rest parameters)
```

where `string` is a “word” in major mode symbol name, `replacement` is
another string to be used instead, `parameters` is a list that may be empty
but may have the following keywords in it as well:

* `:prefix`—put it in the beginning of result string
* `:postfix`—put it in the end of result string

Apart from elements of the form described above the following keywords are
allowed (they influence the algorithm in general):

* `:downcase`—replace words that are not specified explicitly with their
  first letter downcased

* `:upcase`—replace words that are not specified explicitly with their first
  letter upcased

If nothing is specified, a word will be used unchanged, separated from other
words with spaces if necessary.

Example of a setup:

```emacs-lisp
(setq
 cyphejor-rules
 '(:upcase
   ("bookmark"    "→")
   ("buffer"      "β")
   ("diff"        "Δ")
   ("dired"       "δ")
   ("emacs"       "ε")
   ("inferior"    "i" :prefix)
   ("interaction" "i" :prefix)
   ("interactive" "i" :prefix)
   ("lisp"        "λ" :postfix)
   ("menu"        "▤" :postfix)
   ("mode"        "")
   ("package"     "↓")
   ("python"      "π")
   ("shell"       "sh" :postfix)
   ("text"        "ξ")
   ("wdired"      "↯δ")))
```

Next, just enable `cyphejor-mode` in your configuration file:

```emacs-lisp
(cyphejor-mode 1)
```
